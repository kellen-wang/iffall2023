                        <p>Evangelion has had a significant impact on Japanese popular culture. The series also had a
                            strong influence on anime, at a time when the anime industry and televised anime series were
                            in a slump period. CNET reviewer Tim Hornyak credits the series with revitalizing and
                            transforming the giant mecha genre. In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese animation saw decreased
                            production following the economic crash in Japan. This was followed by a crisis of ideas in
                            the years to come. Against this background, Evangelion imposed new standards for the
                            animated serial, ushering in the era of the "new Japanese animation serial," characterized
                            by innovations that allowed a technical and artistic revival of the industry. The production
                            of anime serials began to reflect greater author control, the concentration of resources in
                            fewer but higher quality episodes, typically ranging from thirteen to twenty-six, a
                            directorial approach similar to live film, and greater freedom from the constraints of
                            merchandising.</p>
                        <p>According to TV Tokyo's Keisuke Iwata, the global spread of Japanese animation dramatically
                            expanded due to the popularity of Evangelion. In Japan, Evangelion prompted a review of the
                            cultural value of anime, and its success, according to Roland Kelts, made the medium more
                            accessible to the international youth scene. With the interest in the series, otaku culture
                            became a mass social phenomenon. The show's regular reruns increased the number of otaku,
                            while John Lynden links its popularity to a boom in interest in literature on the Dead Sea
                            Scrolls, Kabbalah and Christianity.</p>
                        <p>Critics traced Evangelion's influence on subsequent anime series, including Serial
                            Experiments Lain, RahXephon, Texhnolyze, Gasaraki, Guilty Crown, Boogiepop Phantom, Blue
                            Submarine No. 6, Mobile Battleship Nadesico, Rinne no Lagrange, Gurren Lagann, Dual!
                            Parallel Trouble Adventure, Argento Soma, Pilot Candidate, Generator Gawl, and Dai-Guard.
                            References, homages and tributes to the series are also contained in Japanese and Western
                            media such as the third episode of Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Koi Koi Seven, Hayate
                            the Combat Butler, Baka and Test, Regular Show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Gravity
                            Falls, Sgt. Frog, Rick and Morty, One Hour Photo, Steven Universe, Kong: Skull Island, and
                            Nope. The show's mixture of religion and mecha also influenced subsequent Japanese video
                            games, including Xenogears and El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron.</p>
                        <p>The design and personality traits of the character Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime and
                            manga characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino of Nadesico, Ruriko Tsukushima (The
                            Droplet), Miharu (Gasaraki), Anthy Himemiya (Revolutionary Girl Utena), and Lain Iwakura
                            (Serial Experiments Lain). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (Excel Saga), and
                            some of her traits were used to create the character of Mai in Gunparade March. According to
                            Italian critic Guido Tavassi
