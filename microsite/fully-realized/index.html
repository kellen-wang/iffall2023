                            <b><i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i></b> (Japanese: 新世紀エヴァンゲリオン, Hepburn: <b><i>Shinseiki
                                    Evangerion</i></b>, lit. 'New Century Evangelion' in Japanese and lit. 'New
                            Beginning Gospel' in Greek), also known simply as Evangelion or Eva, is a Japanese mecha
                            anime television series produced by Gainax, animated by Tatsunoko, and directed by Hideaki
                            Anno. It was broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 1995 to March 1996. Evangelion is set
                            fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm called the Second Impact, particularly in the
                            futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The protagonist is Shinji Ikari, a teenage boy who
                            gets recruited by his father Gendo to the mysterious organization Nerv to pilot a giant
                            biomechanical mecha called an Evangelion and fight against beings known as Angels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The series explores the experiences and emotions of the Evangelion pilots and Nerv's members
                            as they fight to prevent Angels from causing more cataclysms. In the process, they are
                            called upon to understand the ultimate cause of events and the motives behind human action.
                            The series has been described as a deconstruction of the mecha genre, and features
                            archetypal imagery derived from Shinto cosmology as well as Jewish and Christian mystical
                            traditions, including Midrashic tales and Kabbalah. The psychoanalytic accounts of human
                            behavior put forward by Freud and Jung are also prominently featured.

                            Neon Genesis Evangelion received critical acclaim, but was also subject to controversy.
                            Particular controversy centered on its final two episodes, as the ending was deemed
                            confusing and abstract to many viewers and critics alike. In 1997, Hideaki Anno and Gainax
                            released the feature film The End of Evangelion, which serves as an alternate ending
                            replacing the final two episodes. A series of four films, titled Rebuild of Evangelion,
                            retelling the events of the series with different plot elements and a new ending, were
                            released between 2007 and 2021. Film, manga, home video, and other products in the
                            Evangelion franchise have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in
                            overseas markets, with related goods selling over ¥150 billion by 2007 and Evangelion
                            pachinko machines generating ¥700 billion by 2015.
