                            References to mystical traditions in Judaism and Christianity, including Midrashic literature and Kabbalah, are threaded liberally through the series.[62] Complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation,[63] the series reworks Midrash stories, Zohar images and other Kabbalistic ideas developed from the Book of Genesis[64] to create a new Evangelion-specific mythology.[63] The plot also combines elements of esotericism and mysticism of the Jewish Kabbalah,[65][66] including the Angels, which have common and individual features with the Angels of the religious tradition,[67] such as Sachiel, Sandalphon and Ramiel.[68][69] Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki stated the religious visual references were intended to make the series more "interesting" and "exotic" for a Japanese audience,[70] denying the existence of a religious meaning for the use of Christian visual symbols in the show.[71] According to Anno, "as the symbols are mixed together, for the first time something like an interrelationship or a meaning emerges".[72]</p>

                            According to Patrick Drazen, numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi have a prominent role in Evangelion, along with the Shinto vision of the primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami.[73] Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus,[74] the Dead Sea Scrolls,[75] the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, and the Tree of Life.[73] The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project at the end of the series has been compared to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam.[76] The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore,[46] and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni, Japanese demons or ogres.[77]

                            Neon Genesis Evangelion has been interpreted as a deeply personal expression of Hideaki Anno's own emotional struggles with depression.[46] During the production of the series, he became interested in mental illness and psychology.[52] According to him, Rei is a schizophrenic character[78] and a representation of Shinji's unconscious,[72] while Shinji has an Oedipus complex[79][80][81] and is characterized by a libido-destrudo conflict.[82] Similarly, Ritsuko has an Electra complex, in which she loves Gendo, a sort of substitute for her father figure.[83] Anno himself stated that he identifies with Shinji in both a conscious and unconscious manner,[84] while Rei is Anno's "deepest part" and Kaworu his Jungian shadow.[85] Shinji's entering into Unit-01 has been interpreted as a Freudian "return to the womb", and his struggle to be free of the Eva as his "rite of passage" into manhood.[86] The series also contains references to philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts, such as the oral stage, introjection, oral personality, ambivalence,[87] and the death drive,[88] including elements of the works of Sigmund Freud,[89][90] Arthur Schopenhauer,[91][92] and Søren Kierkegaard.[93]
