        <li><i>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</i></li>
        My name is Kellen and I'm a senior double majoring in Design and CS.
        <br><br>
        <li><i>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</i></li>
        I've had experience all around in design and dev, both from class and work experience... but I took this
        class primarily to fulfill my major requirement and maybe sharpen up on some skills.
        <br><br>
        <li><i>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</i></li>
        Yep! I've used the trio since my sophomore year both for classes like CSE 204/330 and my internship in UX Design. 
        <br><br>
        <li><i>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</i></li>
        Maximizing the possibilities within HTML/CSS.
        <br><br>
        <li><i>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</i></li>
        Designing layouts that are compatible for different screen sizes. 
        <br><br>
        <li><i>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</i></li>
        <a href="https://us.supreme.com/pages/shop">Supreme USA shop website</a><br>

        <a href="https://www.kepler-interactive.com/">Kepler Interactive</a><br> 
        Loud, and intensely interactive, effectively communicating the capabilities of the site developer as they're pitching their work through constant movement, animation, microinteractions, hoverstates, etc.
        <br><br>
        <li><i>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</i></li>
        <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/">Bruno Simon Personal Website</a><br>
