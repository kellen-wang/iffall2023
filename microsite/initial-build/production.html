                            Director Hideaki Anno fell into a depression following the completion of work on Nadia: The
                            Secret of Blue Water[24] and the 1992 failure of the Royal Space Force: The Wings of
                            Honnêamise sequel project, Blue Uru.[25] According to Yasuhiro Takeda, after the failure of
                            Blue Uru Anno agreed to a collaboration between King Records and Gainax while drinking with
                            King representative Toshimichi Ōtsuki;[26] King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for
                            "something, anything".[27] Anno began the development of the new series in 1993 around the
                            notion of not running away, which had been the underlying theme of Aoki Uru, which focused
                            on a protagonist accustomed to avoiding personal responsibility who finds himself trying to
                            save the heroine of the story.[28] Early into the production, he stated his intent to have
                            Evangelion increase the number of anime fans, named otaku in Japanese, and attract interest
                            in the anime medium[29] bringing a breath of fresh air to the mecha genre. In the early
                            design phase of the Evangelion project, several formats were considered, including a film, a
                            television series and an original video animation (OVA) series. The producers finally opted
                            for the television series, as it was the most widely accessible media in Japan at that
                            time.[18] Anno also originally proposed the title Alcion for the new series, but this was
                            rejected due to its lack of hard consonant sounds.[18] He conceived the series as a metaphor
                            of his four-year depression, as he tried to put his whole self into the work and imprint his
                            own feelings on the film.[16][30]

                            Critics noted how Evangelion borrowed certain scenarios and the use of introspection as a
                            narrative device from a previous Anno project entitled Gunbuster.[31] He also incorporated
                            the narrative structure of Nadia and multiple frames of reference, leaving the story open to
                            interpretation.[32] The production was complex and saw several changes to the scenario
                            initially imagined by Gainax. A female protagonist was initially proposed for the series,
                            but the idea was scrapped.[18] In the first scenario, the first episode presented the battle
                            between an Angel and Rei, while the character of Shinji was only introduced after the Angel
                            had been temporarily defeated.[33] Further changes to the plot were made following the Aum
                            Shinrikyo sect's sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March. Azuma Hiroki has said that
                            the original Evangelion story was "too close to reality" from Anno's point of view. Anno
                            thought that the original scenario was not suitable for broadcasting, and he feared
                            censorship. However, he also criticized Aum Shinrikyo, because "they lost any contact with
                            reality". For this reason, Azuma stated that Evangelion "is an intrinsic critique of
                            Aum".[29]

                            The final version of the story reflects inspiration drawn from numerous other anime and
                            fictional works.[34] Chief among these are Space Battleship Yamato,[35] Mobile Suit
                            Gundam,[36][37] Devilman[38][39] and Space Runaway Ideon.[40][41] The series also
                            incorporates tributes to Childhood's End,[42] the novels of Ryū Murakami,[34][43] The
                            Andromeda Strain, The Divine Invasion, the poem Pippa Passes,[44] The Hitcher, and several
                            television series including The Prisoner, Thunderbirds, Ultraman[34][45] and Ultra
                            Seven.[46] The development of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series ran close to deadlines throughout its
                            production run. The initial cuts of the first two episodes were screened at the second
                            Gainax festival in July 1995, only three months before they were aired on television.[47] By
                            the thirteenth episode the series began to deviate significantly from the original story,
                            and the initial project was abandoned. The number of Angels was reduced to seventeen instead
                            of the original twenty-eight; the writers also changed the story's ending, which had
                            originally described the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack
                            from the Moon.[33][48] Not only did the series suffer from scheduling issues, but according
                            to Anno, despite Gainax being the lead studio for the series, the company itself had
                            inadequate materials and staff for the full production of the series. Only three staff
                            members from Gainax were working on the series at any given time, and the majority of the
                            series' production was outsourced to Tatsunoko Production.[49]

                            Starting with the sixteenth episode, the show changed drastically, discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for a narrative focusing on the individual characters.[50][51] This change coincided with Anno's development of an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness.[52] This focus culminated in a psychoanalysis of the characters in the two final episodes.[12] Necessity forced Anno to abandon the script of the twenty-fifth episode to work with a new one.[53] These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation,[54] flashbacks,[55] simple line drawings, photographs[56] and fixed image scenes with voice-over dialogue.[57] Some critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts,[58] but Toshio Okada stated that it wasn't only a problem of schedule or budget, since Anno "couldn't decide the ending until the time came. That's his style".[59] These two episodes sparked controversy and condemnation among fans and critics of the series.[60] In 1997, Hideaki Anno and Gainax released two animated feature films, providing another ending for the show, named Death & Rebirth and The End of Evangelion.[61]
